<p>Never will I forget the sparks of light I have once met nor the sky through which I have once soared. I’ll follow light’s path once more and illuminate you.</p>
<p>“This is the kingdom of light, where boundless stars speckle the sky, where there sings the billowing sea, and many children, pure and lovely, you will meet. “</p>
<p>I was told this once long ago as I nestled into the warm capes of my parents.</p>
<p>That was—well—a long, long time ago...</p>
<p>The stars, the sea—my paradise—was, from then on, all torn away from me.</p>
<hr>
<p>##1</p>
<p>“Wake up.”</p>
<p>Was someone calling to me? I wondered blearily.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes, glancing at the sandy shore. I could hear several white birds taking flight together.</p>
<p>Their wings drew down a dazzling shimmer of sunlight to my eyes, and I covered my eyes in response.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst for how long, I had fallen down upon an island - or rather - a place that should have existed no more.</p>
<p>It felt so very familiar to me: the sandy shore, the bright blue sky - I was horribly bewildered.</p>
<p>Was it not all gone?</p>
<p>Tears welled up, beginning to sting. Thousands of long gone ancestors were once here, fighting to protect the kingdom - to protect all of us.</p>
<p>Eventually, I stood up and continued onward, towards a tunnel. I could feel my tattered cape brushing against my clothes. Everything had been brought to ruins by the Red Storm.</p>
<p>I was reminded of something unacceptable..</p>
<p>I could not fly anymore.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter awakened me from going any further into despair. I looked up, “What is that?”</p>
<p>Who was there?</p>
<p>Two figures seemed to be playfully running about faraway, but I could only recognize the brilliant colors of their capes. They seemed to be speaking though I was too far to understand anything.</p>
<p>Suddenly, before my eyes, they stood up as they spread their capes and flew towards the gathered clouds with hands intertwined—like sparks falling into the sun. As they flew, the sunlight cast down to highlight a dazzling pattern of sparks trailing off their capes.</p>
<p>It was incredibly beautiful, but I was puzzled.</p>
<p>How was it possible to fly?</p>
<p>I turned, looking at my cape who had lost all its luster with slight hope and back towards the flying figures. Realization dawned on me.</p>
<p>They were my people.</p>
<p>After the kingdom crumbled, the children who had survived what their parents could not had became the only remnants of civilization that once flourished the land, and the cost of it all was that we could not remember each other nor the perished ancestors.</p>
<p>They—no—we were the Descendants of Light.</p>
<p>I could not help but want to catch up with them; however, I found myself unable to fly or call out to them.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Clouds dance around the sky, like wings of the faraway temple. How vast they are…</p>
<p>A gust wind blew with each flap of the countless birds playing as they dove in and out of the clouds.</p>
<p>I stared at them bleakly—the Descendants of Light—as they flew further and further away from me spreading and closing their dazzling capes, gliding between the clouds, and occasionally freed themselves of flying and slid down the clouds, making short but gleeful sounds of happiness.</p>
<p>They belonged to the sky, while I… did not.</p>
<p>Clutching my tattered cape, I turned away.</p>
<p>Loneliness suddenly engulfed me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2">2</h2>
<p>I tread across the soft grass. The white flowers swayed gently to the breeze, outlining the sky. Birds occasionally flew into the meadow. It felt as warm as the embrace of the Elders.</p>
<p>However, looking at the sky, I felt a cold, bitter darkness swallowing me. That warmth had soon gone away</p>
<p>My eyes suddenly found a shadow.</p>
<p>For some time now, I realize, someone was at the corner of the meadow. He carried a small piano, curiously staring at me. I was just about to leave, but he ran over; a swarm of golden butterflies followed him as he came.</p>
<p>I tilted my head. It was my turn to stare at him.</p>
<p>My heart fluttered uncertainly.</p>
<p>The moment he stopped running, he forged a small candle.</p>
<p>It gave off a slight heat, but I did not know what to do—I could only stand there looking helplessly at the flame warming my face.</p>
<p>Although I had seen the same actions being performed from my observations, I still had no idea how it worked. It surely was some kind of mysterious magic being at play; the candles would form a bond of some sort…</p>
<p>I stood there stiffly, but he continued to hold out his candle. He was persistent in his pursuit.</p>
<p>Sparks flew out from the candle, splashing onto me. It seems that I had accepted whatever proposal he had for me.</p>
<p>In panic, I ran away.</p>
<p>From the corner of my eye, I could see him looking at his candle in doubt fumbling with it in regret wondering whether the magic had failed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3">3</h2>
<p>I stepped into the Hidden Forest. It was a place surrounded by lush, ancient trees with faintly glowing mushrooms growing on them. My eyes were dazzled by the hues of mellow blues and rich greens.</p>
<p>Rain drizzled down to surround the forest with mist. Water droplets came down to envelop me, bringing a slight chill.</p>
<p>Looking around, I recalled that the mushrooms had a healing effect which replenished the warmth taken away by the rain.</p>
<p>Memories of the past surfaced as if time reversed—the past me who had once explored and played here.</p>
<p>As I jumped onto a mushroom, I began to float softly up and down. A warm feeling passed through me. It was like flying and reminded me of the sun’s warmth.</p>
<p>The silence of the forest broke as I bathed in comfort. A distant sound chirping brought me back to reality.</p>
<p>There was a bird hidden beneath another mushroom nearby, sheltering from the rain. It seemed to be chirping for help being stuck under the protection of the mushroom with nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>I hopped off the mushroom and made my way to the bird, picking it up. My hand caressed the bird, and it slowly closed its eyes, chirping softly.</p>
<p>I took a few steps out, wanting to set it free.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a brilliant flicker of light gleaming in the forest.</p>
<p>It was the same guy from before.</p>
<p>He flew, landing right in front of me and took out his candle once again. The bright glow of the flame brushed against my cheek.</p>
<p>Sighing, I gestured towards the bird in my arms</p>
<p>I could not fly, but he could. He was the one who could set the bird free.</p>
<p>He stood silently for a moment until he finally understood what I meant, putting away his candle.</p>
<p>My eyes followed him as he flew away into the distance holding the bird in his arms. I thanked him silently in my heart.</p>
<p>Continuing, I had reached deep into the forest and arrived at the temple of the forest Elder. From the entrance, distant sounds of notes and chords being played could be heard.</p>
<p>Listening to the music flowing out from the temple, I silently made my way through, hiding behind statues and the forest cover trying my best to avoid confrontation.</p>
<p>It was not long before the sound of a piano came from behind me.</p>
<p>Turning around, I saw the same person yet again. He must have returned from releasing the bird.</p>
<p>His head was lowered, playing the piano seriously. The light glistened on his cape, and fireflies danced around him as if attracted by the piano’s soft lullaby.</p>
<p>He seemed… to have always been able to find me.</p>
<p>I crouched down and watched him silently as he got up.</p>
<p>He let out a call then took out a candle. The flame of the red candle was filled with fiery warm hues. It gave off sparks that was different from the previous ones he had held up.</p>
<p>I stared at him helplessly, clutching my cape in surprise.</p>
<p>The boy let out a call again, urging me on.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>A candle appeared in my hands as I raised it to touch his candle’s flame. Our candles touched and a brilliant feeling of warmth came down upon my heart. My cape seemed to have become a little more lighter than it already was.</p>
<p>The same call for which he had made came out my lips.</p>
<p>My heart, which had been filled with confusion, became a little warmer.</p>
<p>The light illuminated his figure, and his appearance became clearer. His short white hair fluttered with the wind, his eyes filled with joy.</p>
<p>“I finally got to light you!” He said happily as he straightened his cape.</p>
<p>His voice was like the sunshine after a rainfall. It was warm, despite not being very deep</p>
<p>“How… How were you always able to find me?” I questioned.</p>
<p>He scratched his head sheepishly. “You’re always hiding somewhere, and you never fly or go anywhere with fewer people. I might have never met you, but it’s a gut feeling I guess.”</p>
<p>I continued staring at him, but with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>He took my hands, and smiled brightly. “Wanna fly?”</p>
<p>I nodded though we were already running.</p>
<p>My eyes reflected the light shining onto us as we ran out from the covers of the temple. With our capes spreading, we flew towards the sun. The soft clouds enveloped us.</p>
<p>It seems as if I could still hear and feel the cool, distant sound of raindrops. A few birds always passed by, brushing against us as we soared across.</p>
<p>The wind pushed against us and scattered our hair. I was filled with euphoria, my eyes full of warmth, and the corners of my mouth turned upwards. As we tore across the clouds, there revealed a hidden winged light.</p>
<p>And with my arms outstretched, my hands wide open, I reached out and grasped it.</p>
<p>The light clutched onto me and spread across my cape now gleaming with brilliant colors of yellow. Energy surged through me.</p>
<p>I had learned to fly once more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4">4</h2>
<p>| In this chapter, the main characters went to the Golden Wasteland Valley of Triumph and Vault of Knowledge. |</p>
<p>Since then, the boy enjoyed taking me to various places after the Hidden Forest—places where I probably should be heading towards as well.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” I pointed at the floating lights.</p>
<p>“Fragments. They’re fragments of light left by the ancestors for us.” He said, taking my frozen hand and grabbing the light with his other hand, “Let’s collect ‘em.” and he jumped down with me, sliding forward.</p>
<p>The wind blew back my hair which blended in with the snow, but my hands remained warm.</p>
<p>A voice suddenly came from beside me, “Do you still remember our ancestors?”</p>
<p>“No… I—I don’t remember. After so long, we’re all still looking for a trace of them if only just to bring back everything, and—well—help them rest in peace.” I answered honestly as we approached a steep slope.</p>
<p>I felt his hands tightening as we sled down.</p>
<p>“We definitely can do it! I mean—find them! At least eventually. Hopefully…”</p>
<p>A puff of steam left my lips as I let out a small smile, touched by his encouragement.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>“What are those?” I pointed at what seems like moving rocks.</p>
<p>“Ummm... those are crabs.” He seems to know them well, pulling me back, “Careful, they’ll knock you down.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” I looked back at the crabs crawling around.</p>
<p>We were in the “Golden Wasteland” (as my friend calls it), which seems.. oddly unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The once beautiful sky had been coated with looming green hues. Menacing grey clouds—still coated in green—blocked the sunlight.</p>
<p>Something dark colored the waters. It clung to me, sticky and oozing along like pus.</p>
<p>I had a sickening idea.</p>
<p>My hands were tightly clenched in his.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>“And what is that? Looks like a dog…” My hands were directed towards a floating blue figure taking the form of a dog.</p>
<p>He burst into laughter “Pffft, that’s just the ancestor’s spirit—they’re camouflaged!”</p>
<p>I stuck out my tongue, rolling my eyes, and proceeded to take his hand, leading on.</p>
<p>We continued past the waterfall of falling stars and climbed the stone stairs covered by blue blossoms. When we reached the top, we knelt down before the ancestor’s tombstone, praying solemnly.</p>
<p>The spirit caressed us with a smile donning his lips and turned to look above. Finally, and still, with a smile, he flew, turning into one of the stars that riddled the Vault of Knowledge.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Walking out, we took a deep breath of the fresh air.</p>
<p>Stars surrounded us, and the faint flowers underneath our feet lit up before our eyes.</p>
<p>My friend sat down and began playing his piano, his fingers glistening over each key, pressing them softly. The music flowed out quietly accompanied by the mellow humming from the insects around.</p>
<p>As I sat down in front of him, my head nodded as I began to feel drowsy; I had to prop up my head.</p>
<p>The sound of the piano abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>“If we keep going, we’re going to reach the Eye of Eden.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” I slowly opened my eyes, tiredly, “Yeah?”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous if you go any further, but, as long as you reach the end, you’ll truly be reborn.” He looked at my still broken cape, “You’ll be able to live a new life!”</p>
<p>I lay down and stared at the sky. Stars twinkled in and out of the darkness, and I imagined they were the ancestors smiling at me.</p>
<p>“Do I have to go alone?”</p>
<p>It took a long time before he answered, “…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I—I’ll definitely come back!” I had never seen him so grave before, and I responded lightly hoping to brighten the mood.</p>
<p>He sighed, but started to play his piano again.</p>
<p>I was slowly lulled into sleep as the instrument’s music seemed to drift further and further away. I could smell the grass’s aroma.</p>
<p>The world grew just a bit darker, and a hand silently brushed over my head.</p>
<p>“May you…”</p>
<p>And all was silent.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5">5</h2>
<p>I had a dream.</p>
<p>It was all the things I had forgotten.</p>
<p>I dreamed of holding onto my parents’ hands as we flew, laughing loudly together by a campfire in the snow as we held hands, and watching the sunset fade like a bright orange lollipop. After gathering fruits and herbs, my father would always take us back before nightfall.</p>
<p>At that time, none of us knew that we were the Children of Light; born by light, gone by wind.</p>
<p>—Until we came back late one day.</p>
<p>It was already near midnight, and my father was carrying me who had been drowsy. Along with my mother, they had snuck back in, to the village, through a stone walkway.</p>
<p>“ How did this happen?”</p>
<p>A roar from the entrance of the village had awoken me, and my mother covered my mouth. We were hiding behind a boulder.</p>
<p>“I… I couldn’t save them; their body had already become stone—their whole body was black! They’re not even human anymore—that storm with red rain—it was beyond my control!”</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t you tell them? They are waiting for you to cure them! ”</p>
<p>“No… I can’t—they won’t follow me anymore as an elder! After all… I—I took them into the storm…I had taken away their light myself…”</p>
<p>“… What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The divination elder already knew… we can only live with light, because we have to forge candles by collecting them. But once.. once the candles are taken away…” he paused, “within the storm—the red rain—we’ll die. We’ll die slowly and surely…”</p>
<p>“And you ignored it? Is that how you survived? You’re an elder! The next candidate for high priest!”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“They—They believed in you… is that how you repay everyone? Are you going to watch them die next?”</p>
<p>“No, no! Trust me, I’ll find a way… No! You can’t go like this!”</p>
<p>There was a loud noise accompanying his words.</p>
<p>I suddenly sat upright, waking up. The morning sun shone on my face.</p>
<p>My friend, with his staff, had set off a huge firework which fell with a great boom. He bounced away and turned towards me making a puffed up face.</p>
<p>I smiled helplessly at him.</p>
<p>Was this what you call “cute?”</p>
<p>I patted off the debris from my body as I got up and headed towards the last door.</p>
<p>As the portal swallowed me in, I looked back at the island bathing in dazzling sunlight—breathing in the pure, untouched air. My friend was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>And thus, I turned back towards the darkness with determination.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6">6</h2>
<p>I could only recognize the fuzzy outlines of candles in the distance as I looked around the pitch-black storm. I bowed my head, resisting the raging wind as it swept towards me and took a step forward. My teeth gritted with the wind continuously pounding against me.</p>
<p>The tragedy that had occurred many years ago brought fear rising in my heart.</p>
<p>I found a purpose, even if I came here without one.</p>
<p>I wanted—with them—to protect this new world together.</p>
<p>Trying to withstand another surge of wind, I leaned down and pushed my body forward into the wind; my cape was slowly darkening. I was slowly losing my sense of direction, dizzied by the incredible force.</p>
<p>I clutched onto my cape and fell.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There was someone beside me.</p>
<p>Although I did not know how long it had been, I found myself awake with my friend beside me still with his piano carried on his back. He was staring off into the distance, dazed.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” I cried out. My heart clenched, anticipating the worst possible scenario.</p>
<p>With a solemn look, he stood up, taking my hand, and uttered, “I’m going with you.”</p>
<p>I smiled hesitantly and took his hand, “… alright.”</p>
<p>“There will be a red storm ahead. It was what destroyed our ancestors thousands of years ago.” He remarked as he pulled me along slowly.</p>
<p>My hand was gripping his tightly. I had already half-guessed what would happen only that he was hiding it from me.</p>
<p>“Stay close, don’t be afraid.” He pushed open a door.</p>
<p>Before us, there were countless stone statues—dead individuals—and a pool of dark, murky liquid. This was the end.</p>
<p>Our ancestors had once said that all those who had died will eventually return here.</p>
<p>The Eye of Eden.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>While we were trying to discern any sense of direction, the constant pouring of the red rain was already in full view. The air felt like it was being ripped to shreds by the wind, and chunks of red stones were torn apart. They fell into the black liquid causing a splash into the air.</p>
<p>My hand was pulled as he led me forward, dodging the chunks of red rock. Occasionally, we would take a short break as he stopped by and lit up a light shrine.</p>
<p>I noticed beads of sweat welling up on his forehead and mustered up a huff of air towards him.</p>
<p>His ears flushed as he continued to pull me forward.</p>
<p>As we continued, the wind became even more forceful, and red rocks began to fall more and more frequently. Our capes began to blacken rapidly; we could no longer fly.</p>
<p>I bit my lips fearfully.</p>
<p>“GO!” He suddenly yanked me back, blocking the dense red rocks from with his cape. I could see his body beginning to darken—sweat ran down his body like rain.</p>
<p>I dared not to speak as I dragged him along with me.</p>
<p>“Hurry! Go!” He shouted.</p>
<p>He was kneeling, his legs already starting to stiffen. It was difficult to move any further.</p>
<p>“You’ll die!” I covered my eyes and begged, “Please! Hurry and leave!”</p>
<p>He shook his breath, breathing heavily, “No. I won’t—I promise…”</p>
<p>Finally, he collapsed. A blue light appeared in place of where he was, circling me as if urging me to go on.</p>
<p>I wiped the tears from my eyes. The bitter taste of tears still lingered in my mouth as I ran.</p>
<p>Finally, I collapsed. My tears continued to roll down as loneliness filled me.</p>
<p>It was all over. I could feel the exhaustion and pain rising.</p>
<p>I had been reborn.</p>
<p>The blue light that was following me floated into the air and disappeared. I began to start walking again through the pouring red rain, giving my light to the kneeling stone statues.</p>
<p>Our ancestors had once said that light was our life. By giving them my light, I wish that they had felt a final sense of reassurance and warmth. Although I was battered and bruised, I sill had overcame my fear that I had kept within me for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Everything was worth it. The statues began to glow blue, some already becoming blue spirits. Praying for their new life, I staggered out of Eden with layers of cuts upon cuts from falling onto broken pieces of rocks in the pool filled with black.</p>
<p>Lots of reborn souls were there. I was walking the same path as they had, sacrificing my past, and gaining new life from the dead, star-filled ancestors.</p>
<p>Warmth filled my heart. I truly had became one of the Descendants of Light of the new world.</p>
<p>Everyone from that disaster had come to be reborn alone.</p>
<p>I wanted nothing more than to return to the land where light ruled.</p>
<p>A land of beautiful midsummer nights where insects chirp happily, and back to the sounds of a piano.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>For some reason, someone was stroking my head. Looking up, I saw a small black figure. Although I could not see clearly, I feel that it must be carefully looking at me.</p>
<p>“Remember me? I’m you. The dead you—the one who died thousands of years ago, sacrificed.”</p>
<p>I stared at the figure uncertainly who had sat down, wiggling his tiny toes on a cloud.</p>
<p>“I’m the you who had abandoned yourself. The one who could watch your people—your ancestors—dying in front of you. The one who had shed her cape to be reborn.”</p>
<p>As the figure spoke, I could feel hot tears slowly cascading down my face. My heart felt suffocated.</p>
<p>“You’re really strong, don’t cry. Another person might have helped you, but the one who can truly change herself is you, isn’t that right? You have people you want to protect, and you have places you want to go now.”</p>
<p>I slowly got up and hugged the figure.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago, the cowardly me had allowed the people, the ancestors, and my own parents to be taken into the storm while I watched on from afar.</p>
<p>That elder had not spared anyone who learned of his secret—not the other elders, nor the innocent villagers. He would rather prefer to kill everyone himself.</p>
<p>Young children could no longer wait for their parents to return. Instead, the Eye of Eden—which was the gateway to another world that the elders had artificially brought unto us—began to absorb all the storms of the world, but it had exploded in repercussion and took the shape of the red storm that destroyed the world.</p>
<p>The remaining survivors—us—were shielded by the magic created by our parents and ancestors; waiting until the day we would come back thousands of years later.</p>
<p>They knew what would happen, but they could not stop the inevitable.</p>
<p>I who knew nothing and lived in fear, are you still okay?</p>
<p>A strange feeling began to fill my heart. It was not the warmth from others that dispelled weariness and exhaustion, but a kind of self-healing.</p>
<p>Looking back on scars and my vulnerability—accepting it all, I was being reborn. I had the courage to protect the ones who I love now.</p>
<p>The figure gently patted my back. There was silence for a while.</p>
<p>I heard a whisper, “If you want to go back, fly up though the gates of the World Tree, and you’ll be able to go back home.”</p>
<p>I nodded still in our embrace for some time until I stopped.</p>
<p>“Where will you go?” I uttered.</p>
<p>“I? Well… if you want, you can always think of me.”</p>
<p>The figure waved at me, and I could faintly make out a big smile that graced her face as she appeared further and further away from me.</p>
<p>“Farewell—”</p>
<p>Farewell, past me.</p>
<p>For I had found a light I wanted to protect.</p>
<p>My tears disappeared into the shimmering stars that painted the sky as I spread my cape and flew upwards.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7">7</h2>
<p>| This is the end of the story. In this chapter, the main character met the one of the elders, who was the piano guy’s father. |</p>
<p>I opened my eyes yet again.</p>
<p>A yellow petal brushed against the tip of my nose, glowing; a white bird chirped beside my ear, its round eyes looking at me curiously; and a gust of wind came, but fled just as quickly.</p>
<p>I got up, but before I could look around, I was knocked to the ground by another gust of wind. My newly born cape protected me, flashing a bright light.</p>
<p>A flock of birds flew up, but their wings could not match the cold expression of a man before me.</p>
<p>I looked at him in disbelief, my clenching.</p>
<p>It’s the Elder…</p>
<p>“Why—Why did you—” I gripped my heart, the pain was wiping out my light.</p>
<p>Another wave of wind was about to hit me, and I flew up. I eyed him sideways indifferently, looking down at him from above.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you still alive?&quot; The Eye of Eden was too overpowering; no one could have survived. &quot;Unless...&quot;</p>
<p>I dare not to imagine any more.</p>
<p>“unless their light were taken by me! The power of their light combined was enough for me to survive the disaster. Well, well aren’t you so clever?” He said looking at me with disdain and viciousness clouding his eyes, “It took me a long time to find your elder uncle, I can’t let you live!”</p>
<p>I found myself long fallen into his trap.</p>
<p>“You’ve been planning for this for thousands of years?” I looked around uneasily.</p>
<p>“I just knew there was a connection between the land and Eden… Just as I suspect, there was no need to climb there step by step! As long as I get there this land shall be in the palms of my hand! It was all thanks to you, my dear.” He laughed, raising his hand slightly.</p>
<p>A golden butterfly landed on his fingertips</p>
<p>Accompanied by his words, strong winds attacked me from all directions. I tried dodging through the icy windstorm, heading straight towards him, but I was cut off by a sharp wind cutting through in front of me.</p>
<p>“Father!” A boy carrying a piano on his back walked towards the elder and I. Stopping, he bowed slightly towards the elder in greeting then looked back towards me silently.</p>
<p>His gaze was different from his cold tone; they were as warm as they always have been.</p>
<p>Ah, so that’s it.</p>
<p>The first warmth I had gotten despite the coldness around. Our first encounter was still clear in my mind.</p>
<p>My heart clenched even more so, but it finally sank in firm reassurance.</p>
<p>I believe in him. He deserved my trust.</p>
<p>“You lost.” The elder smirked, &quot;He's the undercover agent I sent by your side, guiding you step by step into my trap. Too bad you didn't die in Eden, but you won’t be able to escape now.”</p>
<p>He raised his hand about to launch another attack at me.</p>
<p>“…Father.” A blade passed through his heart, “You’re light has darkened.” It was the piano boy.</p>
<p>The blade reflected a blue light.</p>
<p>I had watched as the boy took out a blade from his small piano. Tears welled up in his eyes as the elder collapsed, gripping the stabbed spot shocked; the elder roared out in pain, sending out a wave of intense light.</p>
<p>He yanked his lapel hard, gasping for breath, but his long, white beard began to turn grey and black—his face darkening and liquefying running down and boiling like muddy water.</p>
<p>“Wh—Why, why did y—” He uttered as his eyes turned red with pain; soon, the sound from his mouth became indistinguishable. His broken voice moaned horrifically.</p>
<p>In a flash, he dissipated, turning into red light. It seemed to be painfully broken up, twisting as it disappeared completely.</p>
<p>Silence filled the air.</p>
<p>The boy with the piano—no, my friend—knelt as tears flowed down his face, trying his best to hold back. His tattered and broken cape on his back was noticeable. It should have been the result of being injured by the red storm, and an incomplete rebirth.</p>
<p>I walked over to him and crouched down beside him, watching the dissipating windstorm blow across the soft green grass. Golden butterflies emerged from underground caves, dancing and twirling as they carried warm, yellow light from below the ground to the clear blue sky.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about” I looked at him and asked.</p>
<p>He did not answer, seemingly trying to control his breath.</p>
<p>I took his hand, holding it tightly and looked out. I could feel the island breeze softly caressing me; the light of the sunset poured down on us, draping us in twilight.</p>
<p>After a long silence, he finally lifted his head towards me.</p>
<p>“I…” He trailed off, “Do you blame me?” He asked regretfully.</p>
<p>I chuckled. “Don’t be dumb, silly. How could I?” I had not expected his reply.</p>
<p>Reaching out my hands, I relaxed back, and reached out towards the sunset, capturing the warmth of the setting sun.</p>
<p>“I lied to you,” He whispered, hugging his legs, “I’m sorry…” He looked at me, who was watching the sunset.</p>
<p>I turned towards him, “But you also saved me!” Smiling at his surprised look, I continued, “And—before you recover—I’ll protect you!”</p>
<p>He buried his face. After a while, he spoke.</p>
<p>“I thought I would hate my father… but I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Because he used to be your light, right? If you can’t put it down, don’t push it away. He’s been saved by you. You, too, are worth being saved—by me, by yourself.”</p>
<p>He lowered his head even further, wiping his tears with his hand.</p>
<p>I pat his head, and tapped gently on his hand.</p>
<p>“Just look up at the sky,” I said.</p>
<p>He followed my directions and looked up, his red eyes reflected the waning sky.</p>
<p>Millions of twinkling stars were being warmly embraced by the rising night sky. They sparkled playfully, spreading happiness and warmth.</p>
<p>I thought back to a scene of my people, parents, and ancestors together. All the silhouettes of people who loved to fly and play on this land were gathered around.</p>
<p>“The ancestors once said that those who you love and who you care will turn into stars, protecting you forever, so… don’t be afraid.”</p>
<p>His eyes shone. “Really? Are the stars… are they real?”</p>
<p>“Well, the sky is where the ancestors are. They won’t lie,” I answered.</p>
<p>It was, in a way, a reassurance to myself as well.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he called out to me somewhat sheepishly as he got down on one knee.</p>
<p>He took out a white candle, and the flame reflected a small rainbow. It was as luminous as the sun in summer—more beautiful than every color, brightening the sky and illuminating his smile as well as my heart. It was a glow that of which I had never seen before.</p>
<p>Unhesitatingly, I carefully touched the light, receiving it slowly.</p>
<p>I could feel light burning into my heart, and my body erupted into light.</p>
<p>Before the warm blaze of the candlelight, I—who had been holding his hand—flew into the sky.</p>
<p>Joy could not hide herself. It was as if I held the world, treasuring its beauty.</p>
<p>I looked back at him who had been pulled up by me, smiling brightly.</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“It’s a memory of friendship.” His eyes regained their luster, and I could even see a hint of mischief. “And it’s proof that you will become a star.”</p>
<p>I did not reply.</p>
<p>Instead, I took him further into the sky, searching for the faint but constant light.</p>
<p>【Warm souls will eventually meet again】</p>
<p>【And after a long day, we will finally be together once more】</p>
